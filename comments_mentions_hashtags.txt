Comments on hashtags and mentions

MENTIONS
Indeed, the most common ones are names of parties and politicians
(@cupnacional, @JuntsPelSi, @CiudadanosCs...). 
At frequency 38, media start to appear (@tv3cat, @btvnoticies)
I would say we can for sure remove all mentions that appear only 1 or 2.

HASHTAGS
I made a file with the "distribution" of every hashtag in stance. These are hashtags that appear at least 4 times in all the data (both languages together)
I also made lists of hashtags that are only in favor, only against, only neutral.
And I also have the hashtags that are "never against", "never in favor". Should I add them all here?
